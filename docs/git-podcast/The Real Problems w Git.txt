00:00 hey TJ we need you to lead today's standup take bring us in TJ okay I hope this comes with a pay raise welcome
00:06 everybody uh welcome to today's standup i'm Tee today's scrum master with us we've got as always KCtorii eagle expert
00:13 extraordinaire we've got Prime chief entertainment officer and because trash who is at Renderatl hey if you see trash
00:20 on the internet you can give him a little shout out say "Hey heard you're doing a cool talk." Tell him something like that and then in the comments say
00:26 "Trash give the talk on the next standup we want to hear we want to hear your good thing okay so let Trash let him
00:34 know you want to hear the talk anyways in his place we've got Veganbot one of these directions who knows vegan why
00:40 don't you say hello okay i didn't hear anything he just said so his mic's broken now we're going to
00:46 move on okay so what is the topic for today we're going to talk about Git
00:54 uh anyways sorry well first I want to talk about why everyone is wearing a black shirt except for me was there some
00:59 kind of memo that went out before the standup that was like everyone should look like Steve Jobs are you all wearing jeans at the same time like what's going
01:06 on right now okay so TJ is fully in on the What the heck is going on here is
01:12 this some kind of Apple like memorial thing what is happening you know we just
01:18 called TJ a glass hole that's all we do casey have you ever worked a liquid
01:24 glass right here this is the liquid glass this man's throwing some liquid out hey okay uh Beegan we can hear you
01:31 again say hi you can actually say Casey have you worn a turtleneck cuz I'm going to be honest I gave TJ's first
01:36 turtleneck this he gave me this turtleneck i gave him I Because if you don't know when I travel I usually carry a couple extra turtlenecks in case my
01:42 friends need to go out and so he was like "Hey you want to wear one?" And he's now been wearing them ever since so
01:47 wow you feel kind of you feel different that's why I was like I'm ready to be the scrum master today this this changes
01:53 everything Casey so I feel like throw one on you can lead the neck stand up you know what I'm saying i don't have one i'm trying to think if I've ever
01:60 worn a turtleneck you need to Did my mom dress me up in one when I was three or
02:05 something like that's the only thing I could think of as It's never too late have you read the book series uh Misborn
02:12 uh no I haven't and also you know I I haven't ever I I I I don't uh watch
02:18 Elizabeth Holmes's uh fashion channel or anything so I don't really know that much about turtleneck wear okay well I
02:25 was only saying that because in the second book for him to become more kingly he has to change his dress and
02:30 accept it and often people will perceive you different so TJ immediately has more authority than everybody else simply by
02:38 the you know the dent of his clothing okay yeah it's called aura these days I think yeah okay all right if you can see
02:45 your neck no aura if you can't see it's the mystery well I mean you don't have a
02:50 neck like for me I'm not really a neck a neck hav and so it's it's pretty
02:55 difficult to see do you think people would say that when TJ puts this turtleneck on he has the RZ yes would
03:03 that be something that could be said by the by the youth of today yeah i don't think you I don't think you typically
03:09 put a definite article in front of RZ he just has Riz he has Riz there you go all
03:14 right anyway today for some reason you guys want to talk about Git is my
03:20 understanding and we've actually pulled the audience for some questions oh believe it or not
03:27 and I have them pulled up that's why I wanted to run this meeting today cuz I've got materials they're not in a
03:32 slideshow format they're just in like 37 different tabs okay um but that's just
03:38 as good that's what they tell me so here we go it's more than a phone iphone you know
03:44 that's kind of what I feel like now now I've got like slides behind me and everything yeah um so anyways so we were like we're gonna talk about Git we're
03:50 going to go about rebates merge i feel like initially before we get to the rest of the questions Prime hit us with your
03:57 hot takes about Git Rebase versus Get Merge i want everybody to be fuming in the comments by minute five okay it's
04:03 very very simple merge is for kitties rebase is for experts next question okay
04:12 excellent casey any rebuttal uh my rebuttal is going to be
04:18 towards the end of this part so okay we'll wait i'm going to go ahead and rant after this is is done and that will
04:25 rebut all of the things that were said excellent began any thoughts rebase verse merge yeah I don't have to rebase
04:30 or merge i use the friend flag and it always just goes through so straight away just throw that dash f everybody's
04:37 your friend they message you always right afterwards
04:43 dude you literally see them whoa exclamation mark dude exclamation mark what did you push today question mark
04:49 exclamation they're hyped you know what I'm saying they're like wow this is crazy we're really proud of your progress i always I force push to every
04:56 repo I get access to just to make sure they are either protected or they're my friend you find out either yeah it's
05:01 like friend classes in C++ this makes more sense developers are you tired of code reviews that just say
05:07 looks good to me or here's seven things I need you to change that are irrelevant to the PR well meet Code Rabbit AI
05:14 reviews right inside your editor starting with VS Code cursor and wind surf sorry no Vim yet hit review and bam

05:42 at code rabbit.link/primeogen-vscode links in the description and ship
05:48 cleaner code today all right so I've got a few questions here we'll just go through them see where we get to number
05:55 one from our lovely friend Trash i I want to put trash first because he was
05:60 there um why do I reglone the repo after a botched rebase which I knew would go great after Prime said rebases for
06:07 experts um I'm not even sure what he like honestly
06:14 I know trash is trying to make a joke is what I think i actually don't even know what he means by that how do you botch a
06:20 rebase you never get like halfway through and realize you committed like the wrong
06:26 tree you tricked in theirs instead of ours cuz they're backwards or anything like that
06:31 no this is seriously such a How do you even botch a rebate that's exactly what you botch that is what you botch that is
06:38 the area where Thank you dude you d-abort if you're in the middle of a rebase and say a conflict happens and
06:44 you mess up the conflict you're not in the right place you do a little dash dash you know abort that's pretty easy
06:50 you can go you can do a little ref log and go back from whence you came i I don't I don't know what I don't know
06:55 what the I don't like I when I say I don't understand what it means to botch a rebase like I literally don't know what it means to botch a rebase talk
07:02 about getting a a merge conflict and then not being able to resolve it because you're going to get that merge conflict either way whether you get
07:08 merge or you get rebase that that conflict's coming in vegan okay I want to tell you what what it actually looks
07:14 like let's say we got a like a big old merge conf like so many changes you're going through them all you're sitting
07:21 there you're just you know you're you're dding out the little lines you know that's what I do okay uh you're you're
07:27 bit half paying attention you got a podcast over here you're watching a streamer you know and some subway surfers you did one file really good you
07:35 really made sure pull in those changes don't pull in those changes oh I actually do want that change the next one you got a little lazy on you got and
07:42 you messed up and all of a sudden you go "Oh no I don't even know what I did." And so you could abort i don't want to
07:47 abort i just I did one three files good a couple files bad so now I'm in this
07:52 like botch rebates world when this happens sometimes what I'll do is I'll clone the whole repo i I'll save that
07:58 state as like as as terrible botch zone and then I will say "Yeah that's good." And then I'm with you i know what's
08:04 going to happen restart copy files over from that botched one it happens Prime
08:10 this is normal idiot behavior but I mean but that but that happens with merge too
08:15 because merge you merged you got the same You're overindexing on rebates here I think yeah you you you get the same
08:21 conflict and then you do the exact same thing which is you're doing really great on your first file and then after that
08:28 you totally jack it up but now you don't have an abort
08:34 i think you're getting overindexed on the rebates trash is just saying he's just making the joke about reccloning like Beacon is saying i think you're
08:40 overthinking this yeah I know that's why I said I don't get it because of the rebates part yeah see I wasn't trying to be a jerk vegan i'm just saying you're
08:46 doing the thing because it happens with merge or rebase this is a n you're you're focused on the wrong thing i
08:52 think trash is overindexing on the rebates you're focused on the wrong thing you're you're you're doing the thing of like why would you need a
08:57 debugger don't write bugs no no no that is not true what's happening here is trash is trying to make a joke and he
09:03 knows people hate rebase and will be the most likely to agree with him so he puts the word rebase after something that
09:09 doesn't make to teach do not like that tweet teach stop it oh my gosh
09:16 all right next next question what's the best way to deal with merge
09:21 trains when you've you know so this is he's saying you've take you have one piece of work you break it into a series
09:27 of nice neat little tasks each are individually QA and reviewed but they are depending on each other is git good
09:34 for this Casey why are you asking me
09:40 you work with people because I know I just want you to keep saying I'll rebut this at the end
09:46 you have any opinions you have Yeah my opinion is that this discussion is why all this stuff is so freaking ridiculous
09:53 like the fact like your job is to program a computer you're supposed to be spending your mental energy figuring out
10:00 how to make good programs right and instead like 25% of every programmer's
10:06 brain now is occupied with things like should I merge or rebase that even the
10:12 fact that that is something that is now a discussion means this was a failure
10:18 source code control should be invisible right it should guide the correct process so that no one thinks about it
10:26 just tells you what you need to do to do whatever it is that you're going to do I'm just supposed to program that's what
10:32 I'm supposed to do and then if there's a conflict it should be like okay here's the thing we send the correct emails we
10:38 we get the you know schedule the meeting whatever has to happen that source control is supposed to facilitate
10:43 programming but instead programmers are facilitating source code control it's completely backwards right and so it
10:52 this needs work people should be fixing this instead of spending all their time
10:57 arguing about whether you're going to rebase or merge or what exactly you're supposed to be doing for large files
11:02 like oh do you guys use the the virtual file system thing that they did or do you use this other plugin how it's like
11:08 no this stuff should have been solved no one should be having a discussion right
11:13 so perforce got it right um well perforce is its own kind of pile I would like
11:19 perforce has serious problems with large repos as well uh like very bad uh and so
11:25 perforce has some benefits I guess you could say but in general like the thing that I wish people focus focused on was
11:32 that source code control is not solved like like it is not a solved problem not even close right it's like we need
11:39 people to be pushing this stuff forward because anything you look at is pretty
11:44 bad when you look at what the optimal flow would be for people versus how much they're actually doing right so what is
11:51 the ideal source control then because honestly like in all reality I neither think about merge nor rebase i just
11:58 operate in the way that I'm used to yeah we know and and that's it and I just pull push that's it and so I've never
12:05 really thought much of I I spend very little headroom to this stuff because I already learned it so what what what
12:10 does a transparent source control look like well like the what we use here is
12:17 one where literally I just type done at the end of the day and it just sucks up everyone's work that they've done and it
12:24 like remembers the states of things and that's it and if two people have done something at the same time it just
12:30 overlays those two things it it actually just provides you copies of both and lets you know so that you can then go in
12:36 and resolve those at your leisure or not right and that's just optimal for small
12:41 teams because you know if you have hundreds of thousands of people then you're not going to want to do something similar to that right but there's no
12:49 there's no benefit to something like Git for us because it's just a tremendous amount of complexity for no actual
12:54 benefit right and you can add to that the fact that for a very long time something like git wouldn't have even
12:60 been an option for people like us because we have very very large repositories right even though we're
13:05 small teams when you work on art you know we've got many many terabytes in our central server right and that's just
13:12 completely out of the question for git until more recently when they you know when they decided that that was
13:18 something that people were going to actually handle so in terms of the optimal source code control the optimal
13:24 source code control system a would just be something like what we use would be a setting you could pick so you just like
13:30 pick like we're a small team so everything should just be completely transparent because we don't need any of
13:35 you know any of the complexity stuff that a large organization would need everyone should basically not even have to touch source code control especially
13:42 artists it should just kind of work right they just do their work and you know it gets sucked into a central you
13:48 know versioning system for them and they really don't have to think about it right and for programmers it should just
13:54 overlay the files just say okay someone else did these changes at the same time you can resolve them at your leisure or
13:59 not it's up to you but I'm not going to bother you about it until you know you actually say you want to do something
14:05 and uh that latter point is actually pretty important to me so this happens even to my own self so if I have two
14:12 different machines let's say I'm developing on one machine and on another machine and I make some changes that both affect the same file right
14:19 i don't want it to tell me I can't check in that's absurd like I don't want to create another branch i don't want to
14:26 have to do anything i just I made these two changes when I type done i want you to back up what I'm doing and I want
14:32 that to be available on both machines and I'll deal with it when I deal with it okay don't stop my programming
14:39 because you think your repository has to be in some pristine state i know what I'm doing so just go away right so what
14:47 I like is one where it's just like I deal with stuff when I want to deal with it not when the source code was and I
14:52 don't have to do anything to make that happen i don't have to create branches or create different versions of things
14:57 or any of that sort of stuff it just works my experience with Git and the reason that I don't like it very much is
15:04 whenever I've tried to do even simple stuff with it like pair program with somebody using Git simple stuff like
15:09 that where it's just like "Oh I just want both files i just want to back up this thing." It's like nope all of a sudden you got to learn more git stuff
15:15 did you want to create a fork did you want to do this do you want to do that what's your solution problem i don't want to solve the problem right i just
15:22 want you to back up my files and have everyone have access to those files easily when you're talking about a small
15:27 number of people none of these things are problems right it we're not worried about oh we're going to break some
15:32 thousand person org because somebody checked in like a slightly wrong file or something like that right so anyway so
15:38 Git to me is like it's not uniquely bad i don't hate Git specifically i just hate that we're still in this world
15:44 where people can even have these discussions or all this stuff or that if someone like me wants to use this at our
15:49 company forget it it would like it would slow us down massively to switch to something like Git because it just adds all this process and all this knowledge
15:56 people have to have for no reason at all especially artists right who they should never have to think about source control
16:02 even existing because it's not really in their they're not necessarily tactical people it's not really in their worldview so that's my opinion on this
16:08 and this is why I don't care at all about merge or rebase because I think as soon as you have to ask the question or even have two things one called merge
16:14 and one rebase you failed there's my rant that's it i got nothing else to say i have so many questions right now okay
16:24 ask them go for it okay so hold on so you just have you have your own custom
16:30 CMS or V a VCS not CMS a V maybe even CMS too you have your own custom version
16:36 control mhm that you just type done and
16:41 it puts your files up onto some sort of central repository and any other developers it also puts their clones up
16:47 and then everything that's not conflicted goes into like the super central repository that's like this is the golden standard now but anything
16:54 where there's multiple edits you actually have like these two files and then until you need to re-edit it it doesn't it doesn't choose it like how
17:01 how do people stay in sync with like say your changes and my changes i'm just curious because like TJ you know when we
17:06 were working on Mordorio it was really just like push pull push pull push pull right we're like not we're just staying in sync and we're not really like
17:12 there's no actual get to it we're just you know the messages were crap it's not like nothing about it was was trying to
17:19 be and the only and to be fair the only time that we had to deal with conflicts would be like when I chose to pull in
17:25 your changes right so like until then I was never experiencing oh prime edited this file so I can't do it so then it
17:31 was fine yeah so basically what it does is it just goes okay if two people have uh
17:38 both made changes to the same file they each keep their version of their file and they also get a thing labeled
17:45 alternate version in the same directory of it's the same as a normal merge of whatever the other file would be the
17:51 only difference between this source code control system and a normal source code control system is that's not a failure
17:56 state it's just like we're going to let that ride you guys will work it out so can you can you make edits if there is
18:03 an alternate version does it freeze you from making edits nope you can just go just keep adding
18:09 alternate it will just it will just track as many versions in place as you want until you guys have decided that
18:15 you have collapsed them like properly and you deleted those alternate versions and then it will assume that you figured
18:20 it out yourself because again on a small team that's what happens if for normally nobody should ever and even this is true
18:27 for a single programmer as well right normally I'm not making changes to the same thing on two different machines
18:33 right but sometimes I am and in those cases I just don't care I don't want
18:38 source code control involved i'll deal with it myself i just want source code control to preserve those things as long
18:45 as it needs to for me to get around to solving that problem or someone else if it's someone else's problem I suppose
18:52 but that's what I prefer right i don't want source code control to lock everything up and say "Okay nobody can
18:59 you you know you you can't do anything anymore you can't even back up your own files unless you create like a separate
19:04 branch or something like this." I don't want that i want to be able to just ride through this especially like maybe those
19:09 changes aren't that integral maybe there was like something you know this other person was doing that's not that important we're just gonna that's just
19:15 going to ride in that side channel for a little while and I'll pull it back in when I'm ready right i don't want I don't want source code control to insert
19:22 a bubble into the process there's no need for it and I can understand why giant orgs you know like I said thousand
19:27 people you couldn't do exactly this although I think if I had to solve this problem at a larger scale I bet I could
19:34 do it uh better like I could use this concept and make something that would work better than the like let's just
19:40 stop everything from happening version but I don't care because I don't work in thousand person or for a single person
19:47 two people four people it's way better to just let it ride in my opinion just let it ride don't have source code
19:53 control in the way just don't have source code be don't have it be a thing right no it's great case i think we have
19:59 all the exact same opinions like we should not be as programmers worrying about source control that's why obviously AI is going to take care of it
20:05 for us since we're on the same page that's right uh you can commit like large things to repos people get mad at
20:11 me because I like to commit like 300 MP3s to a GitHub repo and then GitHub says don't do that we should be able to
20:16 do that holding us back and uh and yeah just save every single version of
20:22 everything we've ever done never ever yes okay that reminds me of the of like it was either from Microsoft or from
20:28 Dell when they were tweeting like "Oh man my computer's so slow." Oh and then
20:33 it was like "Oh yeah and you have like 12 tabs open and Discord and something else." And they're like "Why would you
20:38 expect it to go fast?" Like we everyone's like "That's stupid computers are fast enough to handle that." I do
20:45 think it is kind of crazy that at least for a long time I think it's better now but like we really can't just commit big
20:51 files why does that have to be a big deal or like that we can't commit like actual assets into the repo that seems
20:57 crazy um there so I don't know i I I I
21:02 like branching and like having branches and other stuff like that even at much smaller than a thousand people like even
21:10 at like 10 I would definitely want something akin to like what Git has but
21:18 I think full screen what oh yeah i can go full screen sure make yourself beautiful we're going to go back to this
21:23 later but that's okay here oh this is just me oh yeah there you go big me um
21:30 but I feel like some it let's Casey in an alternate
21:36 world where git has like sane defaults uh has like commands that only do one
21:44 thing like checkout isn't like eight different things right yeah and like
21:50 you're presented with like not silently pulling changes that you didn't know
21:56 someone else made that suddenly like you know what I'm saying like in this alternate universe where I'm a I agree
22:03 with you it feels like a lot of people are saying well we have Git so version control is solved and you're like just
22:08 cuz you have a command line thing that can do something doesn't mean that we've reached the pinnacle of that thing right
22:14 like we can still maybe make it better and yes I know Chad everyone's like "Just use jiu-jitsu." Okay we'll test it
22:20 out later okay and we can get back to you about it all right just relax i We know about JJ just relax okay um but in
22:27 that universe Casey like in this mystical world whether that one exists or not would you feel differently about
22:33 version control i mean I' I've said what my thing is that I want which is I don't
22:39 ever want to think about source code control ever right if I'm ever if at the end of the day I ever type something in
22:47 because I'm like I want my version control to save the work I've done or something and anything happens other
22:52 than I leave right then source code control has failed right like I just
22:58 type I should just be able to type done hit return and that's it and if there's any more work to be done I I just come
23:06 back in the next day and I start working on that thing it should not be like oh I have to worry now about doing something
23:11 else to back up my files right or to save what I've done and a lot of times source code control you do like if you
23:18 tried to push your changes or something like this right so that they're available for other people because
23:23 that's another thing it's not just backing up it's like other people may want to access these files if I want to
23:28 push my changes but there's a conflict it's like you really can't do anything other than say like okay provide those
23:34 as like a set you know provide a different branch or other like no I shouldn't think about any of that I should just type done and I leave and if
23:41 there was some problem with that the source code control should just present that state to the other users of the system so that if they want to grab
23:47 those files they can or if they don't want to they can when I come back in the next day I will you know it will let me know about that that's what source code
23:54 should be helping me right it should not be forcing me to think about what I am going to have to do to make the thing I
24:02 wanted to have happen which is back up the files and make them available to people happen right that should just be
24:08 automatic always and to the extent that I ever need to interact with source code system it should be perfectly prompted
24:13 so just it should come back to me and go like the next morning I come back in there it's like oh hey yeah you two made
24:19 these changes and they're they're in conflict what do you want to do about that nothing right now should be another
24:24 option right but everything should still be available to people and they should be able to see those things I want it to
24:30 handle the problems for me but what I see with git 100% but this is true of
24:35 other source code control as well so I'm not blaming git specifically is that it always makes it my problem right it's
24:41 always my problem to figure out how to put the source code control in the state that's most effective for whatever the
24:47 situation is it should be doing that for me right and 99% of the time it should be able to do that because most of the
24:53 things are not complicated like they're not really ridiculous things right and usually what you see and the reason this
25:00 stuff does get complicated is because the source code control is bubbling up its internal behavior to you like it's
25:06 forcing you to actually care about how it's actually storing things and how it's actually conceiving of things but I
25:13 don't care i just want the state of my machine to be replicable to any other machine i want my machine stuff to be
25:20 stored over time i want to be able to get the the what's on anyone else's machine i want to have any two people
25:26 who change at the same time be available to me at the same time i want all that stuff to be just smooth and I never want
25:33 to have to think about telling the internals of some source code control system what to do to make that happen
25:38 does that make sense can I can I Okay so does this what you're really trying to say is that you don't want to have to
25:45 create branches right because isn't that what you're saying is that your version is if you you're kind of like on your
25:50 own branch that anyone can look at right but it's almost like all branches exist simultaneously in your solution where
25:57 it's like a quantum position you can observe one branch experience it but then if there's two branches in conflict
26:04 you can choose which side you want and then you have at some point somebody has
26:09 to resolve it right if there is an actual conflict which conflicts aren't you know too often nonetheless at some
26:14 point when a conflict happens you then have to resolve uh the the two sets and say "Okay we're going to remove these
26:21 two like competing things and turn it into one change and then this will now make the branches effectively coexist in
26:26 the same position." Well and again it's not like I'm not asking for anything new right because source code control like
26:32 git can already do all of the it can do all of the things that I'm talking about can be done with something like git it
26:39 has the I mean with the exception of the fact that their large file handling always was very bad so you know maybe I
26:45 haven't ever tried the sort of new solutions that they've put in the past 5 10 years to try and get it up to speed
26:51 with that so but putting that aside let's just say we're not talking about large files for right now git has the
26:56 ability to do most of the things that you want here so it's not like I'm asking for something what I'm talking about is the appearance to the end user
27:04 right i mean I'm almost in a very unme way i'm I'm sort of almost saying like
27:10 you need the Steve Jobs of source code control someday to like come in and go this just does what you want right for
27:17 99% of all the people this does what you want without you needing to know
27:22 anything right you don't have to learn some weird stuff to like use your source code control it just does it
27:29 automatically with you never knowing anything right and anytime that there's actually an action you need to take it's
27:35 clearly prompted to you and it's really trivial for you to interact with right that's what I'm talking about and you could build that on top of Git although
27:41 you know it gets jankier when you do stuff like that but you could do it because Git supports the fundamental operations that you would need right did
27:48 someone say Steve Jobs there you go oh go ahead beacon can I provide a counter take yeah I'm here to provide like the
27:53 idiot perspective as always here uh it's like I hear Casey saying like we don't want to have to think about this problem
27:59 i don't want to be the one has to think about how we merge stuff and like my VC messages do it for me every vibe coder
28:05 I'm talking to they're like having a great time vibe coding and then they have problems when they lose their code due to various vibe code reasons the
28:11 thing I end up warning everyone is you have to learn Git it's a painful part of
28:16 coding life but just like I don't want to talk to HR but HR wants to talk to me every day it's just part of working with
28:22 other people they love your jokes they love my jokes so they always want to hear from every day but if I kill it in
28:28 a meeting they invite me in every single time so I for me personally I do feel like version control is a place that
28:35 it's supposed to be a problem cuz you're it's where code meets humans which is terrible if it was all code or all
28:41 humans maybe we could get through it but that it's going to be hard and I want to tell everyone hey vibe coders this is
28:47 going to be hard and painful and don't wish for something that's going to be better cuz this is the hard part of
28:53 coding which we can get around through two easy ways number one you make software with no other people we're able
28:58 to fix this problem just don't do any other people and the other way is just we don't have to ship code either i mean
29:04 I can just you know we can we can all be branching and just so it's like if the more people we work with the faster we have to ship the more of this problem we
29:10 have to deal with and I just don't think I mean I think AI is going to obviously fix all of it very very soon and if
29:16 anyone wants to sponsor the podcast we'll tell anyone that they're gonna they're gonna fix it i don't care what
29:21 it is like there's things that could be helped but this is this is always going to be painful is is my theory i I would
29:28 say I think to like Casey you're saying Git can already it already has all of
29:34 the features you would desire in an ideal version control system in in the sense that it can do all of them i don't
29:40 want to be too stringent about that because I don't use it so like maybe that's not entirely true but I'm just
29:45 saying I know everything you've said so far definitely no he said something that doesn't exist you cannot have a mult You cannot have a uh multibranch universe in
29:53 the sense that I can't check out a project that has everybody's distinct changes and then only in the conflicting
29:59 world choose which person's side do I want to look at you always have could
30:04 just have their own branch but it could simulate you could simulate that using git is branching
30:10 what I mean by that is that I can't like you can't do that because if if you have a set of changes that is different from
30:16 like the core in sync one and TJ has a different set of things i either have to look at only TJ's changes or only your
30:23 changes i can't look at all the changes except for the conflicting parts in which I have to choose which one like
30:28 that that does not exist in git this kind of like uh quantum branching as I I don't know what else to call it like you
30:35 can't view everyone's changes except for the uh well we it's funny you call it quantum branching because in my VCS it's
30:42 called a superp position so it tracks superposition just saying like here's how many superp positions there are for this file like there's there's n of them
30:48 right yeah I totally get this it's a cool idea it's a super cool idea yeah uh well thank you I guess but it's not
30:56 complicated right it's just a it's a simple because fundamentally that's all a sort control system is doing is it's
31:02 saying okay I'm keeping multiple versions of things and so to me I'm just like why not also do that uh in time I
31:09 in this to time do it in space as well right it's saying like at this particular time I can have multiple
31:14 versions of a file as well instead of just having it only backwards in time that I have multiple versions of a file
31:20 and uh again like I just I maybe git can't do some of those things but I'm
31:26 sure it's not that hard to imagine extending git to do them right like the idea of hashbased file stuff it's like
31:31 it could it could it could do this right it's not like it's not like it would be like "Oh my god we have no idea how we could ever extend it." Um but I would
31:38 say even though like with a hundred people you can't do it in a practical way anyways without somebody doing
31:45 something inside of it like don't you think Casey like even like your system wouldn't scale even probably like at a
31:50 100 devs working in like a medium-sized codebase because there's going to be too many overlapping changes like all the
31:57 time right yeah you'd have to do too many selections of the super position at that point well I guess I don't know because if you
32:03 think so again if I then went to a 100 person team and I watched how they
32:10 worked I would probably have I'd be like "Okay here's how we're going to do it because it almost certainly wouldn't be
32:16 what is happening with git right?" So I can't tell you exactly what I would say you would do but it's not going to be git i can tell you that uh and I suspect
32:23 the superposition concept would scale and the reason for that is that you might change a little bit about how it's
32:28 working but the idea that you can you already are saying that you're having
32:33 multiple people who might do overlapping changes so by definition you do have superpositions that exist they're just
32:40 existing only on one person's machine because the other person can't see that change yet right and you're forcing one
32:46 person to merge and you're forcing them based on who happened to hit the push first right it's like somebody tries to
32:52 push to the main repository first so that person gets to push their changes the other person tries to push they're
32:58 like "You've got a merge cloud you got to pull first." Right and again so to me
33:03 that's totally broken i'm like why what if it was way easier to merge these changes in a different order right why
33:10 is my source code control deciding that the way this is going to work is whoever happened to type push first on their
33:17 machine that's the order that we're going to have our company resolve these changes like what so I'm pretty sure I
33:23 wouldn't have the exact same model as I have when you have just a small team where everyone's talking to each other every day and most of the people are
33:29 doing art anyway so it's you don't even really have much problem with these kinds of of uh things but it wouldn't be
33:36 Git right i would still have something that would probably have something with to do with superp positions it would
33:41 have a little bit more rigor to it because I know that the people aren't in constant communication with each other but it would not look like get still i
33:48 can guarantee you that it's just until I went and actually solved that problem I would couldn't tell exactly what it looks like right but I I would say like
33:55 at least in my experience like generally speaking I only have to deal with merges
34:01 when I'm deciding to put it into the same main branch like in general every place I've worked at like we use which
34:08 this is not to say git the way it's structured and the way that it's
34:14 actually implemented makes this easy or good to do right necessarily right but like we would just have separate
34:20 branches for each of the things that we're working on you could do stuff like get work trees that can make it easy to
34:27 work on those same things at the same time on your own system and like not have to wipe all the changes and even
34:33 leave it uncommitted like and everything right and I can always push freely because I'm the only one pushing to that
34:40 remote branch so like the only time I But you had you had to know all that right this is my this is my rant right
34:47 my rant is you had to do that right and and this is why I assume you know I assume and maybe this is naive but my
34:54 assumption is that most places that use Git eventually like customize it like
34:59 you just said where they're like okay here's how we decided we're going to set up all of our stuff right this many
35:05 repositories in this order with this kinds of commands that we use and maybe some scripts that do something for us or
35:12 whatever else they have all this stuff and then it does work for them right or at least it works well enough for them
35:18 like ours works well enough for us right but my point is that shouldn't be institutional knowledge right these most
35:26 things can be solved I think pretty directly and that like you want something that just works off the shelf
35:32 so that people don't have to learn any of this stuff when they go to a company they they know they just type one thing in and it presents them with whatever
35:38 they needed to do if if anything right and I I that's why I get so frustrated with source code controls like it just
35:45 shouldn't be a thing Right um and I don't know that maybe that's just uh
35:50 maybe that's thinking that there's maybe that's that's wishful thinking like it's
35:55 like um uh it's too pie in the sky right like maybe I'm just asking for something
36:00 that could never be or something but it feels achievable and the one we did works great for us so I'm like I feel
36:08 like you could start to think about this harder and just start generalizing more and going like what do teams generally
36:15 want like what is the thing we generally need and is there sort of a more 99% case solution that's way better out of
36:22 the box than git right and uh again there's still going to be edge cases and there's still going to be people who
36:28 would prefer git because they've got some really special thing they're doing with it and that's fine but I think the
36:34 majority of cases um it's just way more complicated than it needs to be and
36:39 requires institutional knowledge to get it into a well-working state egan yeah
36:44 well first of all you know to describe Git breaking it down we're using quantum mechanics uh you know analogies like
36:51 we're like Git is too complicated guys quantum mechanics here's how we can explain it that's that's scary number
36:56 one uh number two I think uh to reiterate what I was saying earlier I think thinking about Conway's law and how it relates to Git can like help a
37:03 lot of this conversation because it's always about how the humans interact with the code so if there's two people
37:09 two engineers and they're working in a similar code place and they're sick of working with merge conflicts you know what they do they split the code up they
37:16 do it themselves like the the code splits up naturally based off these all this tension and who wants to work with
37:21 who and what's going on that's why organizations match the engineers it's like but you can't you can't like from
37:28 on high say everyone make the perfect best code it's going to go dude teach is taking forever on the logging thing i'm
37:34 so annoyed with it i'm splitting out the service and doing it on my own and then boom now there's two different files
37:39 it's like there you never can prescribe what path engineers are going to go because we're all going to just go like
37:45 I'm annoyed i'm lazy boom split the file here do this here no conflicts there so
37:50 humans make everything so messy and I just don't we're never going to replace humans ai is never going to replace our
37:56 jobs ever okay so so but so Casey the only problem I see with your the
38:01 idealist approach you have which a you still have to learn something right you still have to know that you have to commit you have to say something to
38:07 commit what you've done so other people can see it and that you have to know at some point there's a divergence point
38:12 but like you know if Began says "Hey T is taking too long i'm going to create my own service." Bada bing bada boom
38:18 pulls out part of whatever's TJ's working into his own little universe and starts going well now we've kind of come into this point where if Began commits
38:25 this it's almost like you want TJ to be forced to act on that not that it's just
38:30 like oh we can have two different versions it's because like now there's such a drift in it that it's like it's a for like you really do want TJ to know
38:37 that this big thing has happened or else he's going to develop off that and then that conflict becomes a way bigger deal
38:44 in the future because it wasn't taken like it wasn't kind of like forced upon
38:49 TJ in its early conception and that's the only thing I worry about is the super I mean I love the idea of just
38:54 being able to view the repository as a series of changes from everybody but uh you know large organizations obviously
38:60 you're gonna have to choose like 10 superp positions across all of them maybe you can do it automatically because you don't care about those other ones you only care about your kind of
39:06 silo but at the end of the day it just seems like drift can be such a killer in this well like I said I think I would
39:14 want to actually go design source code control for a large team first before I'd have like a strong opinion either
39:20 way because for example the superp position thing i just because you come
39:25 up with solutions to problems when you look at what's actually going on right and this is why I don't like git or use
39:30 git is because it doesn't solve the problems we actually have so like let's say you know to take to take an example
39:36 of of drift in the art side of things it's like usually they just have files that have artwork in them right and if
39:41 two people edit the same file then all an artist wants is to know that there's files on their machine that have the
39:48 work that they did and what other people did and if they go open up a file and it doesn't have the right drawing in it
39:53 they just want another file that's next to that file that does so they can go get it grab it and put the thing into
39:59 where it needs to be right i also by the way by the way I don't think art is good like I don't think git matches how art
40:05 changes just to be clear I think that gets a very codeoriented source control
40:10 approach but my point is that that's basically the same for at least for me
40:19 for when you're talking about relatively small numbers of people developing a codebase it's like look the way that so
40:25 the way the superp position thing works just to be clear is your machine always has your changes as the primary change
40:33 the superp positions are the ones that come in from other people's machines that would have overwritten one of your changes right on the other person's
40:40 machine they have their change as the primary one and your changes are the ones that look like superp positions to
40:46 them right and that's just what works most efficiently even for me against me
40:53 so when I'm doing like changes on two different machines because I just haven't sunk those machines in a while for whatever reason that's just way way
41:01 better than telling me I have to merge something because I don't want to merge it right now right so what you're
41:06 calling drift as a bad thing in a large org is a great thing in a small org because I'm not in the I don't want to
41:11 do the the thing you're calling drift i don't want to deal with that right now right so I just let it sit there and
41:18 it's fine and the same is true with the art side too it's like if they don't want to have to deal with the like merging those two pieces of artwork they
41:24 just leave them and then they clean them up later right and this is just like
41:29 again it's what you see people actually wanting to do like what what is the
41:34 actual thing that people want daytoday and only programmers want source code in
41:40 their face it seems like right they're the only people who for some reason think this is good and I want to interact with it a lot right nobody else
41:48 ever wants to even hear that it exists i'll say the the distinction though I would say is like people everybody uses
41:54 like Google do docs now right like nobody edits like documents offline by
41:59 themselves except maybe like even my grandpa he uses you know sheets now instead of himself like literally you
42:06 know what I mean so it's like I think the reason is because other
42:11 like industries or professions a lot of their stuff like if you're writing or doing other things it can work like
42:18 independent of a bunch of other parts of the system right like I'm in the middle of like drafting a contract or I'm in
42:24 the middle of like making a bunch of art like having one halffinish art piece
42:30 doesn't make it so that I can't compile my booklet of art i don't know what a
42:36 magazine that's a booklet of art y um true i've heard words before but like
42:42 for for programmers right it's like if I have someone else's half done thing I
42:47 might literally not be able to run anything right and like that's kind of like a feature in a lot of ways like I
42:53 don't actually want the code to be able to run with halfbroken uh like code right like someone just literally wrote
42:59 half of a C file okay well that's good i don't want to edit it live in time but
43:05 so like I'm saying so it is kind of different because like other professions it's like oh well we can all just iterate on the doc together we'll work
43:10 on the slides at the same time we'll do all this there is no like merging them in together as opposed to programmers
43:16 where we have to like force all of these things back into one spot so I think it's like very different like in kind
43:21 not just cuz programmers like to make um you know castles of abstraction which is true but like also we have a different
43:28 problem set than like most other like industries well sometimes we do but a
43:34 lot of times we don't right like if you happen to be making changes to some kind of like centralized API or something
43:39 then I agree that you may have to take all the changes at once because you know you changed how some API worked and you
43:45 had to change like all the places that call that API right but 99% of the time especially on a
43:51 small team when you're you know you don't have enough people making changes to enough things to have a high
43:56 likelihood of collision a lot of times no it just it's fine right it's you if you actually had something where two
44:03 file uh two changes conflicted it on your machine either you don't need to actually do that merge just yet or it's
44:10 very trivial for you to do it so you have the superposition right there and if you have a compiler you're like "Oh
44:15 okay i guess I'll deal with the superposition now." So it just ends up being the same as a merge anyway because you can always just choose to merge
44:22 those two files at that time if that's what you wanted to do but you're not being forced to do it so the difference
44:28 is just that git makes you deal with it immediately whether it needed to be dealt with immediately or not whereas
44:33 the superp position version is just like okay you deal with it when you think you need to and if you don't need to right now then don't and that's just better as
44:39 far as I'm concerned because like why would I want to force someone to deal with something that they don't actually need to deal with yet right it's not
44:45 like they're not aware of just you know they see the super there they're like okay I know some people made these changes i could choose to merge right
44:52 now if that's what I want to do but it's like you know and plus merge now is just something that is very obvious to them
44:59 they didn't have to ask to merge they just see the two files and they can cut and paste whatever they want from them
45:05 even if you never taught someone what a merge was they could just do it because they know how to do that with files so I
45:10 don't even have to teach them like oh you're going to have to type get merge or something right or whatever is going to happen you know okay there's two
45:17 quick Oh sorry go vegan you haven't Okay i was I was going to say I'm a little confused Casey because I Maybe you're
45:23 not developing how I develop because the moment I write any code he's definitely not yeah I already know for sure
45:28 identical the moment I write any piece of code I write a a log statement i immediately
45:33 surround it in a feature flag i get that merged in right away it's in production
45:38 i make sure I can flip it on and off and then I keep developing and so I'm merging i'm deploying to prod probably
45:44 every 10 15 minutes whatever I'm changing and if anything breaks feature is that how long it takes you to add a log statement
45:51 well the Docker build is slow okay tj he's not he's not using Copilot he's still manually writing slog statements
45:57 writing the console what you meant is you asked the AI to you asked Claude to
46:02 add the log statement for you and seven iterations later it did yeah all right
46:08 so but you know but yeah you don't have to if you're if you're always deploying you're always synced up you don't have
46:13 to worry you It's annoying obviously because you have to deal with these problems all the time but anytime I want to try any one of my features we can do
46:19 canary deployments that's how Facebook works zuck taught me this technique so wow that's really cool Beacon uh so but
46:27 damn that's crazy there's someone out there in the chat that is doing this process though there's got to be I do it at Netflix all the time everything had
46:33 to be driven through feature flag so it's like every single thing I've ever done always had a feature flag first and then I turn it on just for me and then
46:39 blah blah blah blah all right so two things one Casey used the word sunk to say that you had to sync two computers i
46:45 haven't sunk yet i don't know if slink I don't think slink slang slunk works in this case i I still think it's actually
46:51 just sync uh I love saying sunk i know i just don't think it's I don't think it's real and I like saying macOS
46:59 there's so many things I like to say that you don't like uh I can't remember what there was one other slide i loved it that's the Freshmaker okay i was on
47:05 your team with that that was TJ that didn't like it what was the other one i had some other pronunciation i can't remember what it was anyway don't worry
47:11 i'm the one that calls it Jippity not even Chad GPT it's Jippity so I'm way off weasel instead of WSL i call it
47:17 Weasel because it fits both Microsoft and it's kind of correct if you disinval it oh do you call it like a coo and a
47:23 gpoo as well no but we're going to I'm I'm about to
47:28 if you Okay it's like we gotta program this GPU to do some AI some I computations some A competition i do
47:37 like some C poo okay but the second uh the second thing is is that I've completely forgot what I was going to say i actually had a really important
47:43 point now I can't remember oh all right well while you're thinking of that Prime I've got a few other questions I really want to hit we spent uh 40 minutes
47:49 talking about this one but not really talking about it i actually like this that he has like why why can't this just
47:55 be like what what should version control be as opposed to Git it's just like I
48:00 don't think Git's that great either and I'm totally on your team but you know we don't have to be like what let's answer
48:06 questions about Git this is more like theoretically is Git even good and and again to be clear I don't really want to
48:13 like this was about Git because that's what the episode was titled but I don't have any specific distaste for Git right
48:21 i don't like version control in general i think it is too ownorous and puts too
48:28 much like emphasis on itself i just want like I want the modern versioned file
48:35 system thing that's just like way less in your face and way less something that
48:41 I think about and is only there when something goes really wrong right it's like it's sort of the thing it's it's
48:48 like the safety net for me right is the way I think about these things and so a lot of ECS's and it's not like it's just
48:54 git aren't that they're in your face all the time right and I also so I do think
48:59 there's also this sort of thing prime uh that you know Chad's completely misunderstanding you casey's not saying
49:06 he doesn't want to do likeback files he he wants to develop and things to be in sync okay this is not final version v3
49:13 you're saying you're saying you want it there but you want it to be transparent as if we're all editing the same hard
49:18 drive in some ethereal sense until you say commit i want the magic the magic server right it's like the magic server
49:26 and I feel like we could get there because like I like the little amount of work i didn't spend very long making
49:31 like our VCS is still crappy right it's like it's not some amazing thing that I spent seven years on in my PhD
49:37 dissertation or whatever right don't worry Git was only four days or five days so everything is a piece of crap so
49:42 it's okay yes it was a piece of crap uh and uh but I like it way better than any
49:48 source code control I've ever used to me that kind of suggests that if I was going to go do like let me spend a year
49:53 making source code control things to see what I end up really wanting and what's the perfect thing i bet I could get
49:59 pretty far right and it sure wouldn't look like git i can guarantee you that but again that's not a knock on git
50:05 specifically that's kind of broadly it wouldn't look like subversion either probably right uh or you know whatever
50:12 your favorite source code control is perforce I think was mentioned before i had used Perforce for a while so that's
50:17 Yeah I I did too actually at RAD we used Perforce um Yeah yeah i used CVS
50:22 originally because that was the only thing that existed way back in the day uh and that thing is a real pile like
50:29 Git m you know CVS makes Git looks like like a like a like a holy it's amazing
50:35 like you know compared to CVS cvs was awful right i I hate the pharmacy i'm a big Walgreens guy so I get it
50:44 but yeah so anyway so nothing against Git specifically just VCS in general I feel like has a long way to go all right
50:50 so Casey I got a question okay so you built your own VCS nice custom for your cool work yeah in let's imagine someone
50:57 new joins to work a company you're working at mh how could they convince you hi I'm new employee your company hey
51:03 you're already using Git git it's not good enough i'm going to write my own give me a week i know I just started on
51:09 the job i'm going to build my own version control system and we're going to use that instead what would it take
51:15 for me to convince you to allow me to do that if we were working a job together
51:20 i I'm not sure I totally get the hypothetical you're saying I you're coming to the company and you want to
51:26 write let's pretend yeah you're using Git already i'm using and I you're using Git you're at a company where you're
51:31 using Git and I come in and I say "Hey listen git I don't know if it's going to work i think we can do something better if I wrote my own give me a week and I'm
51:38 going to rewrite to our own version control." How would you be able to who could convince you to be able to do that
51:44 effectively he's asking how did you do what you did yes exactly how did you get it done well just because I'm in charge
51:50 so I can do whatever the hell I want right i mean but the point is that even think about it i also don't think that's
51:56 wise right in other words I'm not suggesting like what I would prefer is that we took this seriously as a project
52:03 meaning it's like we're gonna go off and we're gonna actually seriously develop a tool to do source code control in a
52:10 better way right but of course you know I also understand why it doesn't happen because people don't pay for development
52:16 tools right so really the only way you could do this was as a SAS right it would it would h the the thing that I'm
52:23 conceiving of there's no way you'd ever get funding to do it or to to it would never really happen in the commercial
52:29 world without it being a service right so what you'd really end up with is something where you pay a monthly fee
52:35 and then our company makes all of this magic for you right and every source
52:40 code just works for you you know control just works for you right which again I would love if someone did that right i
52:47 don't know that we would bother because like we have something that already works for us but if you're talking about trying to solve these harder problems
52:52 you want to scale up to 100 person thousand person 10,000 person orgs you want uh you know there to be some more
52:58 flexibility to the workflow it's not just hey what's the workflow at Casey's company is the one that this works great
53:03 for and it doesn't work for anybody else's right um my point is just I'm
53:09 just saying why we don't use one and why I don't like using Git and wouldn't use it because it was very simple for me to
53:16 make something that I prefer uh like quite a bit prefer uh and for a bunch of other reasons too that we haven't
53:22 covered but they're they're yeah sort of minor things i'm just trying to say there's a junior dev out there it was me 10 years ago who would have said "I
53:28 listen to Casey on a podcast he wrote his own version control can I write my own version of control boss?" And they would say "Oh my oh god okay HR it would
53:36 be another HR meeting you're fired." But but I mean to be fair all the people that are listening that have never dealt
53:41 with large assets don't understand that before get uh large file system came
53:46 about it was a huge pain and even still then if you're on GitHub there's a whole
53:51 series of issues when you're trying to do large files still it's not it's not Well GitHub is just bad for a bunch of
53:58 stuff you can't even have a big diff i know you can't even have a bunch of text on the screen they'll be like "We're not
54:04 going to show you that by default." Or like Began had a longunning PR against one of my projects and rewrote the
54:10 entire thing but it literally said infinity it said files changed infinity
54:16 like look we put the infinity sign and said "Whoops our bad we can't do anything different." Well is rewriting
54:24 an infinite number of files we didn't That's a pretty That talk about a 10x programmer that's an Infinity X
54:29 programmer right there that's why he's on the pod began has statistically significant sized diff okay that's
54:36 that's what we're getting at here now I did commit 300 MP3s to that repo yeah but that should Casey's point is right
54:43 and this is the separate thing that should be fine like we have computers that are fast that should be fine so I'm
54:50 I'm with you on that mhm okay my my my big question sort of I do
54:55 still want to just run through a few of these other questions just because we got some good ones from the from the the
55:01 comments but um I feel like a lot of it a lot of Casey your complaint with
55:07 GitHub is not necess or with git sorry I just did the zoom is separate like there's all kinds of extra complaints
55:12 you could have about GitHub completely separate yes like it seems to me you're
55:18 not incredibly like opposed to an idea of like a directed asylic graph of
55:25 changes that we can like move and merge back and do other stuff like that it's more that like git should have like this
55:33 you type get clone or something and it gets you a new repo sure right and then you say like get new feature and you can
55:41 work on that thing all by yourself and you can do anything you there should be like five commands that cover 99% of the
55:47 problems and they should never error weirdly like in that world do you think you would have used git at your place
55:54 assuming you can like do big files and stuff i mean it's really hard to say because it's about specifics right i'd
55:59 have to try things because like I was very familiar with Git like I I've never become a Git expert like I'm I'm never I
56:06 don't even remember half the stuff like I look it up i'm like "Oh okay i guess right?" And then honestly it's like if
56:12 it's anything complicated if it's like because I have to maintain the GitHub some of the GitHub stuff uh that I have
56:17 posted publicly that's my interaction with Git nowadays the only time I I use Git at all nowadays is is if I have to
56:23 deal with something like that and uh you know honestly if there's anything complicated like oops I did this thing
56:29 and I need to remove it or something like that i just asked Martins i don't know if anyone out here knows Martins's Mosao he's he's a he was at RAD and he's
56:37 at uh Epic Games now because they got you know Rad got acquired by them i'm just like Martins help me out and he
56:43 sends some you know large line with hexadimal in it right and all this other stuff that's going to do the thing and
56:50 I'm like I'm sure Glad Martins is around right but again that's also like I never have to do that with my if I just want
56:56 to fix something i know it's very trivial in ours because we don't have things like having to put a bunch of hexadimal into a command line to make
57:02 something happen but that's like an actual thing that occurs in git right um so it would really matter what the
57:08 specifics are it would it would matter how it actually works in practice and I'm just pretty doubtful that Git at
57:15 this point would ever go in that direction anyway so it would probably have to be some new thing um or some
57:22 really really aggressively front end but sometimes that stuff doesn't work like GDB frontends never really very good
57:28 because just the underlying GDBness of it kind of makes it not happen and I think that would probably happen with
57:33 Git 2 so I think you kind of need something where the back end and front end are harmonious uh to really make
57:38 something great in my opinion yeah i and I feel like from from my like I I like
57:43 at least most of the time like that I use Git like compared to other options
57:49 like I think it's good and like overall it's helpful um and I I think I heir
57:54 more towards the side of like I would rather get the conflict from someone else's work like earlier rather than
57:60 later most of the time just because like it just ends up being a lot of the
58:05 time it is not going to take me super long to solve the problem if I get it early but then it gets very complicated
58:12 if it gets later like if we're we happen to be changing the same file and I like
58:17 move a function down lower in the file and then like they edit the body of some
58:23 other function in that and then all of a sudden like it's very hard to reconcile the things i would rather get those like
58:29 as early as possible so for me I would push like way further towards I I would rather get that and have it interrupt my
58:36 work um earlier rather than later so like for me at least on the teams and
58:43 the sizes that I've worked on like generally speaking that would be my preference um although it's like different when it's like me and Prime
58:50 just coding one thing together we pretty much just use it as like Dropbox
58:57 it's really a race to see who pushes so that I always I want to push first yeah
59:03 so uh but okay so let me just let me just do these quick and then we'll that we got a few more here prime prime
59:09 rebases because Prime is lazy as is everyone who rebases it gets rid of all the complicated merge history yeah who
59:14 would ever want to know how things became the way they are oh okay very simple the reason why I do rebasing is
59:21 is is uh first off it's not lazy b the reason why I do that is that I have a
59:26 set of changes i want to be able to test my changes on top of all known last changes i don't want to test my changes
59:33 in between things when I merge something in i don't want to pretend like where I tested it was in fact uh was okay
59:40 because there's new changes now so I have to like know that what I did was correct in that position in time hence
59:45 the reason why I rebase what rebase effectively does for those that don't know it's very very simple if you have a series of changes here and you checked
59:51 out at some point in the past it takes your pointer branch at this and moves it up to the head so that means I am
59:56 testing against all known latest changes checked in and then my changes and so when those are good then I merge it in
60:02 it's really that that's like literally the only reason why I use rebase over merge is because I don't want to be like "Hey everything's good at this point
60:09 merge and then now something can feel broken because I can just merge it in it's not a big deal." Rebasing feels
60:15 like I'm making a conscious decision saying my changes happened here and this is where I want things to happen yeah I
60:20 always felt that merge is more of a lie than a rebase if you're doing feature branches because like I'm testing my
60:27 feature branch on something in the past and then I want to merge it into something that's not the truth anymore
60:33 so I would rather test all of my changes on what it's actually going to be merged into versus what it was when I created
60:40 the branch yeah that's why that's what's going to be reality you looked at me like I'm crazy yeah a
60:46 couple things here i'm with whatever sweet anchovi says I agree prime's lazy so I'm with that part all right all right that's a separate issue number one
60:52 but I think that there's like maybe a subtle difference here are we talking just a regular rebase or are we talking about a rebase maybe with some squashing
60:59 some rewriting of some commits I don't think I don't think it matters when it comes to your personal branch before it
61:04 hits into the main branch obviously when we say rebase we don't mean rebasing like the mainline that's insane no one says that stuff no but I'm saying I'm
61:10 saying before when you're rebasing before you're getting into the branch are you going to say okay I've worked on a feature I've been on a branch I want
61:15 to get it merged in now I 30 commits and half of them say whip whip whip ah ah ah
61:20 fixed fixed fixed yeah yeah yeah I'm fine squashing that into a single change putting that on top doing whatever
61:25 making sure everything is the working the way I want it to work and then merging it in I don't think there's a big difference between many commits or
61:31 uh one commit representing some sort of feature uh just because I rarely look at the past and if I do have to look at the
61:37 past I'm usually bisecting so 20 changes versus one change makes virtually no difference once you're beyond what 250
61:43 commits so I will say the chat immediately The messages are please never squash next comment Dax yes squash
61:52 chat's just wrong at that because they don't dude this is like the classic chat is saying words that they don't understand it's perfectly
61:59 feature to be squashed into its own no there's an argument for not squashing because for especially for someone like you Prime I want to see what you went
62:06 through to get to this feature no you don't no one ever has yes I do i want to know how much frustration how many
62:11 commits are unhinged when I look and I say "Okay that's it's not about fun it's about knowing what's going on inside the
62:18 brain of the coder who got this in." We're trying to put information about how we got there and you shake your head
62:25 because he writes perfect commit messages on the I never write perfect commit messages on my branch i write one
62:31 commit message when I'm done or possibly two or three if the branch has two or
62:36 three useful things that are distinct otherwise I always write nonsense commit messages squish it into one and then
62:42 bring it in okay everyone out there everyone out there who's watching this this is what I'm talking about 100% of
62:48 everything that just got said is not programming that's the point okay all of
62:55 this anything you're thinking about in your head rebasing merging where are the changes how many squashes are we going
63:01 to do what like you're not coding if you're doing that this is why we need
63:06 better version control the fact that anyone even knows these things is a
63:11 problem it's taking up space in here that we could have used for programming
63:16 i'm going to say I'm going to say no because they matter because it's how software goes from not existing to
63:23 existing so I'm not saying Git or GitHub or GitHub pull request view is good i I
63:31 worked at a company that was in some ways competing with GitHub and I was pleading desperately for months can we
63:37 make a better workflow for this that makes it super obvious and easy for people so like I'm with you GitHub
63:44 workflow it's trash i I want to review text it doesn't show the diff etc but it
63:50 does make a difference to say like there there are reasons where you would want
63:55 to do both and it matters and when you work with like I'm just saying like it's very different I think like Casey what
64:01 your like dayto-day thing is versus like when I'm working at a larger company and
64:06 like larger companies will continue to exist at least for a while right so I mean it's like I think it's okay to have
64:13 to learn some things I'm not saying git is the right necessarily abstract for all of it but thinking about whether
64:18 Whether we want to keep individual like saves of your file or like squash it into one large thing that's like a
64:25 question for any system to change track right don't you think i al would like if
64:33 that's what you want if you're worried about like what is the the uh way in which you're going to present this
64:39 information to the user later like this person changed their file end times i mean let's let's just free yourself from
64:46 thinking about how things currently work and just imagine what did you actually want right yeah and the answer is for a
64:52 bunch of cases you didn't want anything cuz everything just worked and no one's going to care then there's some cases
64:58 where things went pear-shaped right it's like this stuff went poorly or something
65:03 broke or something's weird and now we're doing archaeology right so now we got to go back in there what was this person
65:08 doing what's going on i don't understand this change or like everything broke and we need to like go back and and deal
65:14 with it right so there's there's different ways in which you might be looking at this particular thing but the
65:19 one we're talking about is where someone's going to go back and look at this history because they're trying to figure something out like they need some
65:24 information right and if you're just talking about how many files do you keep inside there or what do you present to
65:30 them as like uh as as the uh forensic evidence about what happened right
65:36 well how often they saved the file isn't even that useful in that case anyway i might
65:43 just not push the save key very often right so what you really wanted anyway is just something that tracks all my
65:48 edits as I'm editing and I can just scrub the little bar back and forth i can see how many times the guy compiled
65:54 the thing right and how many times he ran it and what happened that's what you're actually looking for right and
66:00 the fact that like now we've got like oh well source code controls this thing just like any maybe sometimes they save
66:05 the file and happened to hit push or something like it's like that's not even what you wanted anyway so if what you're
66:10 really looking for is forensics okay just let's go implement the forensics it's not hard we could have a thing that just tracks all the stuff in your editor
66:16 and it checks that in and that's what we have and if you actually need to go spelunking in it you go like like I
66:23 don't think that I don't want the thing that you're saying kegan what are you going to say yeah so a couple things I'm
66:28 I'm because I have to emphasize again it's like talking about how Git could work without the human conflicting
66:35 merging part of it it just can't exist it's like talking about the economy and saying and everyone will act perfectly
66:40 rational and logically and based off that we can see the numbers are going to go it's like no but
66:45 we're literally just talking about squash that was what I'm saying sure even like I'm saying like squash we're talking about like
66:51 forensics the people are not it's not just saving we're all as humans encoding information about when we are deciding
66:57 to package things up so like typically if I'm if I might be doing a 100 commits that I want to maybe squash later on but
67:02 those commits I'm probably going to mostly have them be either if they're compilable they're kind of working or
67:08 I'm going to put a note hey I'm going into uncharted territory i'm about to break something and if so when you do
67:13 that forensics it will say whip I'm going into uncharted territory things might break here and then you'll go
67:19 below it and go hey look it actually I'm able to find the bug that we're looking for forensically like it's it's about
67:24 the human information we encode not just me trying to say save we all put secret messages to future us in our commit
67:31 messages especially sometimes when we're like not thinking and just frustrated it's just trying this trying anything
67:37 trying this well cool there were three messages they just said trying something let's work backwards and say what were they doing here none of these you know
67:44 it it is useful information is my my point i mean I'm going to go ahead and say no I don't think it is like
67:49 especially because if that were true everyone would be like you know what comments and code are always right they're always great like the the
67:55 comments are always good like everyone should comment all their code because it's never like no comments in the
68:00 GitHub repository are arbitrary they're not checked by anything they could be completely wrong right and also you
68:06 don't know that people were actually pushing at good times especially when you're talking about large orgs like what you think all the developers are
68:12 fantastic at deciding the exact right time to push something or save something of course they're not right a bunch of
68:17 people forget or they don't know the right thing or whatever so you're kind of talking about an org of only great people or something no I'm thinking
68:23 opposite we're talking the opposite i'm talking about company of course he's thinking of an or of great dats
68:30 i don't I don't I'm not telling you when write perfect commit messages i'm saying the imperfect commit messages has the
68:36 information we need inside of there you know when teach starts a nice repo it's a beautiful first commit message 6 hours
68:42 later it's uggh ug trying ugg and you go "Oo wow maybe this is where things got a
68:47 little bit rough." You you know what I mean i'm I'm going after the imperfectness of developers i think no one's going to do good so I want to save
68:53 all the information that they're spitting out into their What is the information you believe you got from Ugg
68:60 no that that this is a part where where Tee was going off the rails to be clear I'm not 100% agreeing with Bean here i
69:06 just want my He does commit like that hold on time to go go Prime go okay so the reason why I think this approach
69:12 that you're talking about Beacon is fundamentally flawed it's pro it works probably really well in a very small organization but once you get to a large
69:18 enough organization I think there's something fundamentally broken about the idea of committing broken code so I want
69:25 every single point to be working i don't want to bisect and hit weird cases that
69:31 don't exist and I'm jumping further back than I need to maybe I'm accepting incorrect positions i want every commit
69:37 should theoretically be working because the moment you don't have that you break all sorts of other assumptions along
69:43 with that so this is why I squash i squash for the fact that this squashed thing represents my ideal change set for
69:50 this whatever feature bug I'm working on and it's supposed to work now it may contain bugs true but you can then
69:56 identify that that change is it but it is the only thing that Prime is 100% correct on let's go no no no not
70:04 doc's opinion that is a stamp right there certified because guess what's going to happen prime you're going to be
70:10 doing you're going to be doing beautiful nice commit the code's always going to work someone's going to say "Oo I actually did like five features over a
70:15 100 commits there's a lot of messy stuff." I'm just going to put them all into one nice Yeah i say I literally say
70:22 no when I when when I was on a bigger org if someone comes in with 15
70:27 break it up I don't want to deal with your crap split it up into commits yeah you have to make individual commits cuz I don't want your crap because when
70:33 something goes wrong I don't want to undo 16 features if only one of them is the one like one of them is broken break
70:40 it up be smart i'm not like Mr atomic commits like you must have the most ideal smallest change set you'd ever
70:45 have it's like at least come up with like a breaking point that's normal now again this completely changes when it's me and Tee on Mordoria i'm just working
70:52 committing working committing it's smaller project we're meant to move fast yeah it's 30,000 lines of Lua but it's still a small project easy to move on
70:59 very different experience so it just totally depends that's why I'm like on Casey's team completely when it comes to
71:04 what he's suggesting for a smaller team because I'm like "Oh hell yeah if me and T if I could just keep typing and seeing TJ's changing these files and then be
71:11 like "Yeah I want TJ's files yes I want TJ's files." Okay yes okay keep going going going okay TJ you know I've synced
71:17 up there oh we've just have a we have a conflict i'm going to keep working on mine i don't want your conflict yet i'm going to keep going i'm going to keep go
71:23 like I think that's totally cool but a bigger one I'm going to go with a much more stringent approach just due to the
71:28 change volume well real quick I just got to talk because I it is Friday right now and I just talked to one of our devs he just rejected their PR we were supposed
71:35 to get that actually deployed before the weekend right now and you I was told by the dev who you just rejected their PR
71:41 that you want them to just split up the files more is what you wanted like you do know that our burndown charts are
71:47 going to be you know what I'd do is I'd walk into their manager and say "Hey your dev's being an idiot right now you
71:53 are not going to let this keep going on our team either fix your dev or get a new one the end we're not going to let
71:59 this [ __ ] happen listen I would be pissed if someone's deploying on a
72:04 Friday putting in 15 features i'd be like I am not being responsible for this this is your problem your bomb and if
72:10 this goes wrong I'm not even going to answer the Slack message until you fix it cuz that's not me i'm not doing this
72:17 okay well it's it's sad to know that you're not a team player i heard Trash Dev was willing to actually uh do these commits on a weekend his name is So
72:24 maybe I'm going to go talk to him now yes you got to be the promotion again
72:30 get the promotion again can I I So the thing that I feel like is there's like
72:36 the disconnect where I'm seeing is like I think and it's part of what like we're
72:41 all kind of saying but it's maybe a little different is like there are some things that it is important for the
72:48 developer to take time to think about and to do their own input into the
72:54 system that can't just be from this is what I was saying like it can't just be they saved the file a 100 times or they
73:00 ran a bunch of stuff like they need to encode some additional information into the system because that is going to
73:08 allow us to either debug something later in the future it's going to allow me to like look at a big chunk of code
73:15 together in a year from now and wonder how did this line get here i can see that these changes were grouped with
73:20 this particular logical thing may maybe at some point we can get AI to solve all that for us or whatever i know Began's
73:27 ready for that to happen but like that is additional information that doesn't come from the physical like typing into
73:34 the keyboard and and running the code and so in that world where I'm saying like it's valuable to have that and uh
73:40 it's going to require some input you will at least in my mind invariably have
73:46 an argument between some people who are like vegan saying I want to see the Uggs
73:51 in this thing and Prime saying don't show me the Ugg write a good commit
73:57 message with information and logically group these together possibly a version control thing could allow both of those
74:02 i was just going to ask that question like can't we just have it so that it the roll up includes the like drill down
74:08 if you want that seems pretty straightforward does git really not allow that there's no soft commit versus
74:13 hard commit or whatever you're trying like I don't know what word is but okay in that world the developer is still
74:18 having to think about it and they will still have a disagreement or perhap perhaps something that they need to
74:24 learn about how to do that it won't be able to be like inherent to everyone and
74:30 it will be very different at small companies versus big companies right like maybe I don't know if I really
74:35 believe this i like I am if if for some reason someone showed up and was and was
74:41 like "We're going to give you you know $100 million of investment money to go
74:46 build a source code control thing that just works we can do it because I've the
74:52 money that I like I I actually like okay I bet we could build this thing that works the 99% case and most people will
74:59 just use it and the like only super hardcore really tweaky stuff will ever be done with git after that." I have no
75:06 doubt that you could like actually make the thing that just works and granted it has to tie in pretty hard to like the
75:13 way that things work so you know you're talking about it like it's a pretty big project I think but I don't think it is
75:19 I don't think this is an inherently difficult uh or inherently impossible is the word I'm looking for yeah uh problem
75:26 i think it's just like we uh especially because like the things that people
75:31 actually want to do they know when they want to do them and they don't really need to be taught it's like when I want to give my changes to someone else I
75:38 know that that's happening in my head and I'm like now is the time when I give my changes to someone else so all the
75:43 source code really should be doing is mirroring this it's like every time someone thinks they want to do something
75:49 they just push the button and it does that thing instead of what it is currently which is when someone thinks
75:54 they want to do something they now have to translate that into what are the series of gitnesses that are going to
75:60 make that happen and maybe that's like I'm going to squash some things and then I'm going to push or I'm going to pull something first and then I'm going to
76:05 rebase and then I'm going to do this thing it's like no I just push the button that's like it's time to give my changes and it does the right thing
76:11 right uh and so I I do think that's actually a solvable problem maybe call me an optimist in this one case right uh
76:18 but I just do don't feel like it's as hard as it's being made damn optimist i think one of the We'll make one i'll
76:24 never stop just fighting yeah we'll just keep making one more point there's 30 minutes left in the video git stand you're the git stand can we change it to
76:30 be git git stand botbot so I think there's there's like there's a law out there we can pick who to name it after i
76:37 don't know trash is in here so might end up being trash's law the level of git at your organization
76:43 like lowers to the level of the worst person it's not one person pulling it up
76:49 why isn't that Beegan's law that's true for everything that's not just Git that's everything
76:54 that's that's the educational system right there and that's the problem with Git though is that one person can mess
76:60 it up for everyone and then it's like you end up you know putting all these
77:05 things in place to handle the one person messing it up just this is all for Dave like Dave require like we had to do all
77:12 of this for Dave everyone else was fine but Dave showed up so hold on Casey what
77:17 do you think about uh commit hooks then like given vegan's law commit hooks are effectively I want to prevent not be
77:23 vegan's law beans law uh it's vegan's law it's vegan's law you can still be
77:29 smarter than everybody else it's your observation so you're the smart one you can see the whole ele the one that keeps
77:35 experiencing it that's why it's called vegan law or that's what we're going to tell him right now anyway as we as we
77:40 try to brand it began law or or get hooks in general the ability to prevent someone from even committing
77:47 based on some state of your repo because there's pre-commit hooks that are like sorry you're not even allowed to commit
77:54 you have lint right and then there's like oh you're not even allowed to push because you have these things failing
78:00 I mean you know I I understand what people were trying to do with those
78:06 things i think if you needed them then you're probably trying to paper over
78:13 some problem that you have like you've hired some pretty bad people or you don't have a good training pipeline for
78:19 those people and so I get why you would do something like
78:24 that but my my my sense would be that if you're actually relying on those things
78:30 you have a deeper problem and those things aren't really going to solve that problem right they're just going to kind
78:36 of make the problem almost worse because it's like now it's less obvious that you
78:42 have the problem but it's still going on right uh under underneath that that you know there's the iceberg is still under
78:48 the the the waterline right uh so I don't know i don't want to say anything too strong because like I said don't use
78:54 git wouldn't use git but uh it sounds like if you were using git and you
78:59 thought that that was a good idea you may that maybe
79:05 every time I go into an org and there's pre like any sort of commit hooks of any kind or these git hooks you know that
79:11 scene in hot rod where Rod is sitting down and his dad comes in and like tries
79:17 to insult him a little bit and he goes "Cooler heads are prevailing." And then his dad says like one more thing and he
79:22 gets up and goes "You're the devil." And then like walks out and breaks the door uh that's pretty much me every single
79:28 time like "Oh yeah get hooks i could handle this." Do one single thing wrong and I'm just like "You're the devil."
79:33 And I delete him immediately and never respect them again i hate them i can't even handle it at all like I said I
79:40 totally understand that uh I also understand probably what people thought they were doing when they put them in
79:46 right uh correct me if I'm wrong though but a commit hook doesn't have to be like a commit hook could be doing
79:51 something beneficial too like I'm going to go build this thing or something right it doesn't have to be bad does it can it only be bad only bad it's only
79:57 bad oh sorry you didn't type check you're not allowed to commit so it's only it's only ever for preventing a
80:03 commit it can't just if you if you were triggering something off a commit that's called something else yeah i'm not sure
80:10 if you can trigger I've never thought about anything that like triggers like say formatting off a commit and then Yeah
80:16 never beneficial underneath yeah it can't be beneficial it could definitely not be beneficial or it can be you can
80:22 do you can do stuff like that like for example in RVCS right what we have is thing where when you check something in
80:28 it does like you know keyword replacement and some things put stamps the date on things like stuff like that you can't do something like that or it
80:35 can do that yes so that so that's you know I mean that's not bad so there is there's a not horrible commit hook out
80:40 there maybe somewhere no it's in the law they use the end user license agreement has uh has stated that it can only be
80:46 used for evil okay fair enough I think the idea is like at what point does the code become shared by other people if we
80:54 don't think that like a GitHub branch is that if I cuz I don't like a commit hook that's going to prevent me from being able to push to my own branch it's like
81:00 format I'm getting wild i'm coding and I want it on GitHub you can look at it why do I have to go and conform to your
81:07 standards of prettier while I'm getting wild shut up Dad that's what CI
81:13 literally is put JavaScript semicolons or not shut up Dad now obviously CI or I
81:19 hate you slams the door it's my own styles seven spaces seven spaces
81:25 fibonacci tabs seven space tabs make it happen people but you know what I'm saying like it's it's it's really like
81:31 when I don't I only want to be prevented if it's going to get bad into a shared area and I do not think that a pull
81:38 request is a shared area yeah the only thing would be if you had something that could check for secrets getting
81:45 accidentally committed that would be good cuz we've I've had it happen at a company before where we had open source
81:51 repos someone made a branch local like they pushed the the end file never made
81:58 it to production but it did make it to an open git repo yes whoopsie
82:04 now hacker found our end key so there are a few things where I be like "Okay I could be convinced i could be convinced
82:10 by that uh don't let me commit this." But yes I understand our operational practices with you should be rotating
82:16 all of your API keys on a regular basis and so just having this be part of your operational regular workflow like I
82:22 think honestly you should be leaking API keys like once a week to just make sure the on toes it's like fishing attack
82:28 yeah have you ever heard of when I was at Netflix we had something called Chaos Monkey chaos Monkey that's exactly what
82:33 I say yeah it's chaos same when I was at Netflix too we're just dropping our API keys regularly i just made this one
82:40 service does anyone on this podcast besides me not work for Netflix at some point is this just like you guys like this is the Netflix podcast and Casey
82:47 yeah well like when I made this thing called Falor it was literally just to stress test our servers you know what I'm saying like it wasn't for making
82:53 features so that is pretty painful we're not talking about jobs this episode but I will give one piece of job advice that
82:60 I recently learned uh for anyone out there did you know that no one can stop you from adding anything to your Twitter
83:06 bio you can say "I worked at Netflix and went to Harvard." There's no one texting the amount of people getting saved fine
83:13 so just little job advice for everyone out there the amount of people I see posting pictures of being like "Wow
83:19 congrats on being CEO of HTMX from like a recruiter." Awesome awesome yes and
83:25 they reach out to Carson Gross and they're like "Is this guy CEO of HTMX?" And he's like "Yes." Uh anyways the
83:32 entire seauite in fact all right we got time for one more right TJ yeah this one
83:37 is the one this is one more that I wanted I want to give a shout out to Sphere i know he gets a little bit of flack from us sometimes online but we'll
83:43 give one shout out to Sphere here casey is directionally correct yet also defends a worse alternative nice so I
83:50 don't know what that means but we'll consider it a backhanded compliment who knows also dislike get even beyond the
83:56 obtuse Cly so the thing for this sorry for um blinding everybody but I'm only a quarter of the screen this one I feel
84:03 like encapsulates very well a lot of the things that Casey hates about git where
84:09 in the sense like uh you can get pull and then there will just be things
84:14 merged in but they're broken it's like why did you let me do that and said there was no problem then you know it's like how do I check out a different
84:21 branch check out how do I create a new branch check out how do I update components check out um what's the
84:27 nature of h git it's you know history is immutable oh okay splendid so it's like we merged these two things together and
84:33 then it's like so these things never happened in the same time history is ephemeral so like git sets you up with
84:39 this idea that it has a real history and then it just lies to you right or like the get tag that lists all the tags get
84:46 remote-v lists all the remotes get branch- a does
84:51 the branches and you're like can we not agree on like how to list all of something right like all these different
84:57 branch a also list all your remote branches as well and ex so this I feel
85:03 like this is where I'm I feel a lot of you know overlap with Casey in the sense
85:09 that like Git has a lot of arcane knowledge and there do exist a subset of people who are happy to know arcane
85:15 knowledge just to know arcane knowledge and hold that over people and be like
85:20 you have to learn this but I still I still feel like some of it you have to make a decision sometime and so you are
85:26 going to have an argument like prime people were just having an argument before this uh since we posted this tweet they're like just getting ready
85:32 for the you know the squash versus rebase versus merge commit arguments because I believe and then they state a
85:40 philosophical difference not a difference in the implementation of git truly but instead a philosophical
85:46 difference about how the history of a project should be represented and that's where I feel like there can't be a tool
85:53 that can fix that because people disagree you have to have at least two at least and your company can use
85:58 different ones you know what I'm saying so anyways agreed there you go all right that's it thanks for the
86:04 comments everybody i do agree with H uh I mean the thing is is I think we all recognize that uh much like democracy or
86:11 capitalism that it's a very terrible thing but it's just better than all the alternatives currently that I know about
86:18 until I see a better alternative i I will I will I will accept it like it's
86:24 the worst system except for all the others yeah it's when Church Hiller ever said it's the worst system somebody said that
86:30 all the others i remember this quote vaguely also I will say for future episodes uh I do not believe we should
86:36 keep all of our commit history at all i am 100% on the side of squashing everything heads up but if anyone does
86:44 want me to represent an opinion in a tweet you can just DM me and then when I'm on I will be your opinion so just
86:50 tell me ahead of time but guys you do not want 50 messages that say UGG in
86:56 your repo that's crazy okay no it's too late Big no one's watched till this point so they don't even know you're the
87:02 cut this section out we're never going to let people hear this is for the live viewers anyone who's watching live I
87:07 will tell tweet anything unhinged and I will be you on the podcast until they kick me off again
87:14 oh man all right well thanks Began thanks Casey thanks Prime i hope everyone enjoyed this episode talking
87:19 about Git and our wishes and desires for what version control could be maybe we'll check out jiu-jitsu or one of
87:25 these other ones and we'll come back with some better opinions later okay bye everyone bye boot up the day
87:34 errors on my screen terminal coffee
