# The Real Problems w/ Git (Transcript Notes)

Source transcript: `docs/The Real Problems w Git.txt`.

This folder extracts the key ideas from the discussion (mostly Casey Muratori's perspective) and expands them into a design/problem analysis for a "next-gen" version control system.

Files:
- `docs/git-podcast/summary.md`: detailed, structured summary of what was said.
- `docs/git-podcast/key-points-and-arguments.md`: distilled claims + pro/con arguments.
- `docs/git-podcast/problem-analysis.md`: why Git/VCS friction happens; what is fundamental vs accidental.
- `docs/git-podcast/design-directions.md`: concrete system directions and primitives to explore.
