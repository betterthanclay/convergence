## Goal

Make resolving superpositions in the TUI faster and safer by surfacing invalid decisions and providing quick navigation.

## Tasks

- [x] Superpositions screen shows `valid/total` and `invalid` counts.
- [x] Superpositions screen can show validation details.
- [x] Add `f` to jump to the next invalid decision.
- [x] Add `n` to jump to the next missing decision.
- [x] Prevent apply/apply+publish when decisions are invalid (explain why).

## Exit Criteria

- A user can quickly find and fix broken/invalid decisions without manually scanning the list.
